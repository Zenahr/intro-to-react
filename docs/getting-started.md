# Getting Started

> To stay up-to-date refer to the official [getting started guide by Facebook Open Source](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

If you'd like to dive right in without any elaborate setup, you can also just use React by [including it as a script](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html), thought I do recommend following the steps below because we can then leverage the opinions React has on how to do stuff. And remember: "You should do what other people do, unless you have a very good reason not to."

## Requirements

要件要件要件要件要件要件要件

1.  node >= 8.10
2.  npm >= 5.6 

## Create Your First App

Choose a folder to place your new app in and run the following commands in your console/command-prompt of choice (I'll aptly call mine `react-playground`)

```bash
npx create-react-app react-playground 
cd react-playground
npm start
```
